## üìå Description

This repository contains code and resources for a mini-project developed as part of the **Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning Workshop** led by Prof. Neil Lawrence.

The project explores **healthcare access in Kenya** by integrating multiple datasets (health facilities, population census, financial and household data) to investigate disparities in resource distribution and accessibility.

Healthcare access in Kenya is structured through a tiered system of facilities, ranging from **level 1 (community-based services)** to **level 6 (national referral hospitals)**. Specialized healthcare is primarily available at **level 4 facilities and above**, which provide advanced services.

This mini-project seeks to **quantify access to specialized emergency care** by combining population census data with health facility records. Using regression models, the study estimates the **probability that individuals in different regions can reach and utilize higher-level facilities**. The analysis provides a **data-driven approach** to understanding healthcare access in Kenya and highlights the role of facility distribution and population characteristics in shaping access.

The notebook (notebook/mini_project.ipynb) is structured into three main sections:

- **Access** ‚Äì Data acquisition and feature creation
- **Assess** ‚Äì Data assessment, quality checks, and exploratory analysis
- **Address** ‚Äì Predictive modeling and answering questions on access to specialized care
